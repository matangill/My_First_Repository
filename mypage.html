    <p>A Little Bit About Me:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>My life, right now atleast, centers around my new startup Liveby. Which is what prompted me to take this clas.</li>
        <li>I dropped my Matlab class in college after the second day... I'm going to work hard to make sure that doesn't happen this time.</li>
        <li>I'm about to move into an appartment with my little brother, hopefully that will bring us closer instead of the opposite. </li>
        <li>Other than work, I love to cook (favorite recipies are those that take the longest), rike bikes, sail at Branched Oak, and listen to some bad ass podcast</li>
        <li>Them most embarrassing thing that ever happend to me was recently when trying to set up an out of office message, instead my email replied to every email I've ever recieved with my out of office message. So people got hundreds of emails from mee.. . </li>
